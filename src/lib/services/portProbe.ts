/**
 * Pre-spawn port/health probe for embedded services (#6205).
 *
 * Before the supervisor spawns a service child, it probes the service's port
 * and health endpoint. This turns two failure modes into graceful outcomes
 * instead of a raw `EADDRINUSE` stack trace crashing the child:
 *
 *   - A healthy prior instance is already answering  → ADOPT it (skip spawn).
 *   - The port is held but nothing healthy answers    → surface a CLEAR error.
 *   - The port is free                                → SPAWN normally.
 *
 * `decidePreSpawn` is a pure function so the decision logic is unit-testable
 * without binding a real port or spawning a process.
